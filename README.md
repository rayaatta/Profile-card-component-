## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I actually just realised that when you create a grid and dont specify the columns, automatic ones are created when you position certain elements in similar positions. 

### Continued development

In future challenges i wish do direct my focus on using the BEM methodology as i think it's supercool
